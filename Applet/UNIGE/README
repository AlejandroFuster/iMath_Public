The applet(defined in algorithmsapplet.py) has been created to allow the students to test and became more familiar with Machine Learning fundamentals and basic algorithms.
It consists of three tabs:
- in the first tab(defined in appletPage1corretto.py), you can test Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm on a classification task. You can choose between three different datasets (Moons, Circles, 
linearly separable) and set noise, number of samples and distance between classes, and you can tune the main model’s hyperparameters: kernel type, kernel parameter γ, 
regularization parameter C and the approach to adopt in muti-class case (one-vs-one, one-vs-rest).
- in the second tab(defined in appletPage2corretto.py), you can test Random Forest (RF) on a classification task. You can choose between three different datasets(Moons, 
Circles, linearly separable) and set noise, number of samples and distance between classes, but most of all you can tune the main model’s hyperparameters: number of 
trees in the forest and number of features to consider deciding the best split.
- in the third tab (defined in applet_tab3.py), you could study the error double descent phenomenon when approximating a function with a polynomial regressor: test 
error first decreases, then increases, and then decreases again, increasing model polynomial degree. The phenomenon occurs under specific conditions, but the user 
will be able to modify the regularization parameter and polynomial degree and change the training dataset to play with the regressor and see what happens on the
error’s curve.

TO RUN:
put all the files in the same folder, than launch algorithmsapplet.py
