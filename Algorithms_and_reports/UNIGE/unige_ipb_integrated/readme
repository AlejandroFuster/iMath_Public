The aim of the project is to find an algorithm to propose tailored questions to students in math tests. 
We use a combiation of three different Machine Learning techniques to choose the tests' questions: clutering(k-means), graph theory and Random Forest.
Please refer to the Technical Report for more details on the approach.
In this folder you can find the code of the proposed algorithm.
